                First, I need to tell you about my favourite meal. 
                As a young man from Africa, there sure are a lot of choice in terms of food. 
                I grew up eating a wide variety of foods that my mom would cook. They all tasted delicious.
              </p> 
            
              <p> 
                However, of all the food I ate while growing up, my favourite was 
                <strong><em>Bread and Beans</em></strong>. 
                I remember vividly the delight that I always experienced anytime I was served this.
              </p>  

              <p> 
                Anyway, I thought to share with you how to make my favourite meal 
                just so you will experience the delight I always enjoyed, 
                and so you know how to satisfy me when I visit you. 
                Without further ado, let's get it on. 
              </p>
